## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Dominik, a software engineer with a focus in Machine Learning.
Contact me via [Email](mailto:dominik.andreas.seitz@gmail.com) or
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-andreas-seitz-0689/).

## Some cool stuff I worked on
### Custom jvps and vjps in JAX [example](https://github.com/pasqal-io/horqrux/blob/main/horqrux/adjoint.py)
### Custom vjps in torch [example](https://github.com/pasqal-io/pyqtorch/blob/main/pyqtorch/adjoint.py)
### General custom jvp and vjp tutorials [here](https://github.com/dominikandreasseitz/custom_jvp_vjp_tutorials)
### A generic interface to create arbitrary differentiable parameter expressions in JAX and torch [here](https://github.com/pasqal-io/pyqtorch/blob/main/pyqtorch/embed.py)

### Research in Algorithmic Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning
I have previously worked in algorithmic game theory research focussing on solving large partially-observable games which most notably lead to a Artificial Intelligence journal [publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2022.103805).

### Open-source contributions
At [Pasqal](https://pasqal.com), I was responsible for the development and optimization of their main torch-based computational backend [pyqtorch](https://github.com/pasqal-io/pyqtorch) and their JAX backend [horqrux](https://github.com/pasqal-io/horqrux).

I was also part of the scientific software library for quantum machine learning, [Qadence](https://github.com/pasqal-io/qadence).
